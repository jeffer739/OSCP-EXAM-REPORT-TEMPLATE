# System IP: x.x.x.x

## Service Enumeration

The service enumeration portion of a penetration test focuses on gathering information about what services are alive on a system or systems.
This is valuable for an attacker as it provides detailed information on potential attack vectors into a system.
Understanding what applications are running on the system gives an attacker needed information before performing the actual penetration test.
In some cases, some ports may not be listed.

| x.x.x.x           | **TCP**: 1433,3389\ |
**UDP**: 1434,161
